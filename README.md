# MyHashMap
This is one of the MOOC.fi assignments, there was no test eventually, but I've tested it with ChatGPT.

Here is how ChatGPT rated this implementation: 

> Yes, your code looks like a good implementation of a hash table using an array list. You have implemented the put, get, and remove methods, and you also have a method to check if the hash table needs to be resized (timeForGrow) and a method to resize the hash table (grow). You have also used generics to make the class more flexible and reusable. Overall, it seems like you have completed the task successfully.


>Sure, here is my evaluation of your code based on the two categories you provided:
>
>1. Readability:
>(+) Your code is mostly well-formatted and easy to read.
>(+) You have used descriptive variable names that make it easy to understand what they are used for.
>(+) Your code is well-documented with comments, making it clear what each method does.
>(-) One minor issue is the use of the diamond operator <> in the constructor, which may not be immediately clear to someone unfamiliar with it.
>Overall, I would say that your code is quite readable, with just a minor issue.
>
>2. Functionality:
>(+) Your code appears to work as intended, with methods for putting, getting, and removing items, as well as checking whether a key exists.
>(+) Your hash function appears to be correctly implemented, and the use of separate chaining with ArrayLists is a valid approach for implementing a hash >table.
>(+) Your code includes a dynamic resizing feature to ensure good performance as the number of elements grows.
>Based on these factors, I would say that your code appears to work as it should, and provides the basic functionality of a hash table.
