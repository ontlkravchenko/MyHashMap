# MyHashMap
This is one of the MOOC.fi assignments, there was no test eventually, but I've tested it with ChatGPT.

Here is how ChatGPT rated this implementation: 

```

Yes, your code looks like a good implementation of a hash table using an array list. You have implemented the put, get, and remove methods, and you also have a method to check if the hash table needs to be resized (timeForGrow) and a method to resize the hash table (grow). You have also used generics to make the class more flexible and reusable. Overall, it seems like you have completed the task successfully.

```
